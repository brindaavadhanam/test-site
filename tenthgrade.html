  <h3><em>courses I'm taking:</em></h3>
 
<p> <strong>AP Calculus AB:</strong> So far, calc is pretty normal. Some topics are harder than others, like optimization, but overall, it is fun. Right now, we're working on antiderivatives and integrals, which is super fun to me!</p> 

<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p> <strong>HS English 3-4:</strong> I love my teacher so much. We never do anything. We get chips and late passes for prizes almost everyday. Ms. Paulson is known as the chip lady, and I love her so much. I wish everyone was like her. I actually learn in this class :)</p>

<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p> <strong>AP World History:</strong> Disgusting. Utter torture. I don't know which spirit possessed me when I marked this class on my CRF last year. I should've never taken this class istg if anyone brings up Condorcet one more time I will strangle someone.</p>

<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p> <strong>AP Human Geography:</strong> It's only fun because I have friends in that class. If I didn't, I would cry myself to sleep every day (not that I don't already.. jk). The content is fairly easy, but its a lot of busy work and presenting-especially 2nd tri. Overall its chill tho. I'm glad I end my day in this class!</p>

<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p> <strong>Chem 1-2</strong> The yuckiest, musty-est, crustiest class ever. Barely learned anything in the last two trimesters. Class avg for tests is about 50%. I think everyone in that class wants to murder our teacher, including me. Last tri was so much better bc I had a teacher who would actually teach!</p>

<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p> <strong>PBS 1-2:</strong> I had it last tri, and it was fun! Actually interesting and I had Ms. Craig, who's just awesome. The only downside was the annoying freshmen in that class who didn't learn and didn't do anything lol. It was so bad that I had to request to do a bunch of projects by myself. Can't wait for next tri.</p>
