  <h3><em>courses I took:</em></h3>
 
<p> <strong>AP Biology:</strong> AP Bio was a super fun experience for me. Traumatizing at times, of course, but which AP isnt? I know a lot of people advise 9th graders to wait til sophomore year until they take APs. In my case, taking AP Bio freshman year only made the jump from 1 AP to 3 APs (in 10th grade) easier.</p>

<p> <strong>HS PE 1-2-3:</strong> PE was just PE. It was fun, but I never realized how good it was until it was over. Swimming was terrible at times, but with all my friends there, it was a really fun and easy class.</p>

<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p> <strong>Compacted Math (2A-2B-Trig-3A-3B-Precalc):</strong> Compacted was so much fun, mainly because of my friends. I thought it would be super hard, but it never actually was hard until 3rd tri, when I had to take both 3B and precalc at the same time. I hate trig so much.</p>

<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p> <strong>English 1-2:</strong> Just like PE, English was just... there. I had an okay time, but romeo and juliet was the worst unit ever. The only time I truuly enjoyed that chapter was when my teacher played us Gnomeo and Juliet-the og story but enacted with gnomes!</p>

<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p> <strong>Spanish 3-4-5:</strong> At first, spanish was hard because I barely learned anything in virtual Spanish 1-2. I didn't even know how to conjugate lol. But when I got the hang of it, it became very fun. I'm kinda sad I decided not to go past Spanish 6, but I think I would've gotten ruthlessly bullied in AP Spanish bc of my accent.</p>
